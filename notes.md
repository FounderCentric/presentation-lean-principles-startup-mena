# What is an accelerator? 1, SV
//Like Lean, Accelerators are turning into jargon and hype. Bubble. But there's valuable stuff buried in there. Like Lean Startup, we've seen this.  Uconvering value & where we think we're going.

# Us 1, JS
Been through. 20+
Teachers. customers say "attitutde shift" and traction. Design.

# How does an accelerator actually accelerate? 3, SV
//12 month -> 3 months
- lead time wheel-spinning
//getting intros, lots of people llooking in
- culture & attitude
//education
- designed around specific startup goals, not always a funding round 
//(seed-db too narrow - we'll explain why)
//accelerators only succeed on teams succeeding

# Accelerators themselves are being disrupted JS
- verticals (emerge), hyper-verticals (eye care), creative, village, corporate, gov R&d (climate kic)  
- pre-accelerators
- de-integratation (seedcamp/yc , fc, f6s, angellist, hy berlin demo days)

# The Reality (fc-style)
- pipeline
//the model doesn't make sense based on the number/qual of applicants
//integrated first-movers have less of a problem
//seedcamp tour, techstars later-stage, or corporate
- mentor burnout
- investor burnout
- teams exploding
//new big way to fail is team, not market


# Why?
// poor performers as investment vehicle
- visibility (dealflow, or change)
- participation (in Innovation or investment)
- transformation

# The ROI is information
//doesn't work if you just take the old model



# Design
## responsive
//scheduling
## information required
//dashboard
## peer support / peer review
///brantrust
## start at the end
// pitch bingo
